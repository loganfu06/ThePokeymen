Devlog:
- Devlog allows any group member to see the project's current state at any time.
- The project manager will ensure the devlog is being maintained but will not make all
entries.
- The devlog should be a plain text file stored in the specified location (see below).
- When any team member stops working and pushes changes to GitHub, they should
update the devlog, explaining what changes have been made. Include errors/bugs
discovered (or created).
- Separate devlog entries with a newline.
- The most recent entry should be at the bottom.
- Each entry should begin with the following format: FirstL -- TIMESTAMP\n ( e.g.,
JessicaN -- 2024-01-04 22:15 )
