Started the html for pokedex, making tables for pokemon name, stats etc. Waiting for models and inserting data to be done to test

Finished critical views for retrieving pokemon data from api and storing into database, and a view to load all pokemon type data into database.
The view for getting pokemon may require a filtered results list when entering pokemon to add because the api endpoint is specific.
